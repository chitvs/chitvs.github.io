Here are some of the projects I've been working on. Click on the title to visit the project on GitHub and see more.

- [**Wordle Solver**](https://github.com/chitvs/wordle-solver)  
  This project features an automated algorithm inspired by 3Blue1Brown's video on solving Wordle using information theory principles, designed to intelligently guess the correct word based on feedback.

- [**Chess Engine**](https://github.com/chitvs/chess-engine)  
  I am developing a high-performance chess engine in C++, inspired by top engines like Stockfish. It features advanced evaluation algorithms, bitboard representation, and multithreading for efficient gameplay and strategic depth. The engine combines rigorous technical implementation with a passion for chess to deliver challenging and insightful gameplay. (Work in Progress)
