    <h3><a href="https://github.com/chitvs/chess-engine" target="_blank">Chess Engine</a></h3>
    <p>I am developing a high-performance chess engine in C++, inspired by top engines like Stockfish. It features advanced evaluation algorithms, bitboard representation, and multithreading for efficient gameplay and strategic depth. The engine combines rigorous technical implementation with a passion for chess to deliver challenging and insightful gameplay. (Work in Progress)</p>
