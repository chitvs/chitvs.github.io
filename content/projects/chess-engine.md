## Introduction

I am developing a high-performance chess engine in C++, inspired by top engines like Stockfish. It features advanced evaluation algorithms, bitboard representation, and multithreading for efficient gameplay and strategic depth. The engine combines rigorous technical implementation with a passion for chess to deliver challenging and insightful gameplay. (Work in Progress)
